## What Is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is the modern development approach for building enterprise application. Spring Boot minimizes the configuration required for setting up Spring projects. By using Spring Boot, you can accelerate your development speed and leverage the auto-configuration features.

## What Is Spring?
Spring is an enterprise Java framework. It was designed to simplify Jakarta EE development and make developers more productive. Spring makes use of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection to promote good software coding practices and speed up development time.

## What Is Hibernate/JPA?
Hibernate/JPA is an Object-to-Relational-Mapping (ORM) framework. It simplifies database access for Java applications. By using the framework, you can easily store and retrieve Java objects by setting up some simple configuration mappings.

## What is Maven ?
- Maven is prj mgmt tool
- used for build mgmt and dependencies.
When building java prj you may need additional JAR files, for eg. Spring, Hibernate, Commons Logging, JSON, etc.
Approach 1: Download these files from web and manually to the java buildpath/classpath.
Approach 2: Tell Maven about your needed dependencies and it will get it four you. Maven will make those JAR files available during compile and run time.
 

# Development process:
- Initialize prj using: https://start.spring.io/
- Download Zip and unzip it in local.
- Import project in IDE.
 
## File structure:
- Static folder: contains files like - HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.

## Actuator:
### Problems
- How to monitor and manage app ?
- How to check the app health ?
- How to access app metrics ?
### Solution:
- Exposes endpoints to monitor and manage app.
- We can easily get the Devops functionality out-of-the-box
- Simply add dependency to 'pom.xml'
- Rest endpoints are automatically added to app.
- Endpoint with Actuator:
- /health: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
- /info
- /beans

To expose all endpoints like /beans, etc use this wildcard mentioned below in src/main/resources/application.properties file
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

To exclude the endpoints:
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=health,info
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=*

## Spring boot security
- add spring-boot-starter-security in pom.xml
- After adding this as dependency and when u run project, it will print something like below in console:
````
Using generated security password: 40cb2419-707e-4563-b056-5b4bce4de7ba
This generated password is for development use only. Your security configuration must be updated before running your application in production.
````
- So, use above password and username: user

## Running spring boot application from commandline
### Two options:
1. Use java -jar:
    ````
   java -jar myapp.jar
   ````
2. Using spring boot Maven plugin:
   mvnw spring-boot: run
   
#### Steps:
- Go to the prj directory
- Type this command: 
  mvnw package
- Now:
  cd target
- Now:
````
 java -jar jarName.jar
  eg:
  java -jar firstapplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
 ````

## Application properties:
### It is grouped in 8 categories: core, web, security, data,Actuator, Integration, DevTools, testing
### Core:
````
# Log levels severity mapping
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate=TRACE
logging.level.org.luv2code=INFO

# Log file name
logging.file.name=crazy-stuff.log
logging.file.path=c:/myapps/demo

````

### Web:
````
#HTTP server port 
server.port=7070

# Context path of application
server.servlet.context-path=/my-first-app

# Default HTTP session time out
server.servlet.session.timeout=15m
````

### Actuator
````
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health, info
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=health, info
management.endpoints.web.base-path=/actuator
````

### Security
````
spring.security.user.name=admin
spreing.security.password=yash1234
````

### Data 
````
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce
#username for DB
spring.datasource.username=yash
#password for DB
spring.datasource.password=yash12345
````

## Annotations

#### @GetMapping("/")
- used to define route/endpoint functions
#### @value
- used to get value from application.properties file

#### @Component
- it marks the class as a Spring Bean.
- Spring Bean is just a regular Java class i.e. managed by Spring.
- @Component also makes the bean available for dependency injection.

#### @RestController
- It tells the class that it is a rest controller class.

#### @Autowired
- It marks a Constructor, Setter method, Properties and Config() method as to be autowired that is â€˜injecting beans'(Objects) at runtime by Spring Dependency Injection mechanism.

#### @springBootApplication
- It Enables Auto Configuration, Component Scanning, Additional Configuration.
- It is composed of following annotations:
  - @EnableAutoConfiguration
  - @ComponentScan
  - @Configuration
- If we want to use packages outside our spring boot package then:
````
@SpringBootApplication(
    scanBasePackages={"com.acme.cart",
                      "com.cmu.srs"
                      }
)
```` 

#### @EnableAutoConfiguration
- Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration support.

#### @ComponentScan
- Enables component scanning of current package.
- Also recursively scans sub-packages.

#### @Configuration
- Able to register extra beans with @Bean
- or import other configuration classes.



## Inversion Control
Approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects.
#### Spring container (Spring object factory):
- here spring container comes in place.
- 2 primary function s:
- First, Create and manage objects (Inversion of control)
- Second, Inject object dependencies (Dependency Injection)

#### Configuring spring container
- XML configuration (legacy)
- Java Annotations (modern)
- Java source code (modern)

## Dependency Injection
- Two types: 1) Constructor Injection 2) Setter Injection


## Spring AutoWiring
- For dependency injection, spring uses autowiring.
- Spring will look for a class that matches
- matches by type: class or interface
- Spring will inject automatically, hence it is autowired.

## Component Scanning
- By default, spring boot starts component scanning:
  - From same package as your main spring boot application
  - Also scans sub-packages recursively
- This implicity defines a base search package:
  - Allows default component scanning
  - No need to explicity reference base package name
- If we want to use packages outside our spring boot package then:
````
@SpringBootApplication(
    scanBasePackages={"com.acme.cart",
                      "com.cmu.srs"
                      }
)
````
